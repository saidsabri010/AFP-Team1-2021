## Describing the current situation

We, as a team setting up our environment to startup our group project with the following developing members:

1. Sabri Said
2. Dany Razzoqa
3. MaMingke
4. Yang Yizhou
5. Rachid Aifar
6. Pelle Marcell
7. SHIYI WAN

We have agreed to develop a website for web design and devolepment course . The website will have a simple login as well as search engine. Currently we are working on documentation which is an integral part of our website. This will give us ideas so that we will have a better understanding when it comes to implementation of our project.

## Script

User will be able to see the available course name's without registration and that can be done by the search engine, to have full access to the course's the user will need to register through the signup button or Join us button.And after their login,they can do anything in this website ,they will get the total right to read this website,this is only a static website and nothing is dynamic,and user may still log out

## List Of Requirements

 1. Search - The search function get the information from database according to the Data inputed.
 2. login - The login function let user login according to information from database.
 3. logout - The login function let user logout.
 4. sign up - The sign up function add user information to database.

## UI Plan

The interface will be a not so complicated one, a simple login screen and logout and sign up and Search and a dashboard that will have buttons such as; About, Contact Us.a bit of explaination about web designing.our user can simply click these buttons and the website will give reaction,
this website is a total static website so there is no many user interface

## How the system should be and what it should not be  ?

The system should be as simple as we can make it so that the user can easily use it,otherwise,it shouldn't be broken at any point,always working properly(maintenance) which means we should maintain our application to work properly and if any error shows up we have to catch it(for example : try,catch exception).

Data requirements must be accurate, reliable and true. When you make an action request, such as finding, deleting, modifying, and adding, you should ensure that the input data matches the database data. When meeting the user's request, the system should ensure that the data in response to the inspection rate and accuracy rate.

Time characteristics. 
In order to meet the user's efficient requirements, the response time of the data, the update processing time, the data conversion and transmission time, the running time should be within 1-5 seconds. When you need to interact with an external device, such as a printer, the response time may be long, but it should be within acceptable limits.

The systems UI should be simple enough for a person to find out how it works just by looking at it.

__Goal__

one of the must important goal is to get use to work in a project by being a part of time in software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, 
also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com, and spread the tasks for each member of the team. 
But our main goal is to learn new technologies and show our ability to change at a moments notice giving us the import skills we need to work in this voltaile world where technology is constantly changing and getting better,and make the life of user and admin easier .
We want to make sure this application isnt all about the manipulation but also the user experience. If a user enjoys our design and is able to use the website with ease that can be considered a success. We as a team need to work together to make sure that our application can not only show off our skills in data manipulation and be a easy and enjoyable user experience, but also show how we can work as a team and these are the goals for our application.
