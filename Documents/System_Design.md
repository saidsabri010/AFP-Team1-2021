System design
========
## Introduction
In recent years, with the development of the Internet, the application of network technology has been deepened, web page production and website construction have become more and more popular, and various web pages and website construction software have emerged one after another. A webpage is a window for displaying information on the Internet. Whether the webpage is made and designed exquisitely, whether it is rich in content, and whether it is easy to operate is the main factor that attracts users. Web page design and production is one of the basic skills that need to be mastered when learning information technology in the Internet age.

## Overview

A high level summary that every engineer at the company should understand and use to decide if it's useful for them to read the rest of the doc. It should be 3 paragraphs max.we will create a useful system design and help our teammate understand how this program usually work ,and we will make this document as helpfull as we can.

## Goals

describe the user-driven impact of your project ' where your user might be another engineering team or even another technical system specify how to measure success using metrics ' bonus points if you can link to a dashboard that tracks those metrics Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won't be fixing so everyone is on the same page.

## Design
Page planning:
Front presentation: home page, detail page,search, register, login, logout. home page would contain some decription,detail page would describe something in detail,register page will help user register in the wesite ,login page will help user login into this page,and we will use a random database to finish this program


## Architectural plan
The application's design is created via HTML and CSS. The HTML contains wrapper classes and classes have boxes 
where user can type username and password into it and there are also some buttons which can share this website to other friends.
then we have some taps which show user different topics of other information
As it is a static webpage ,you can do fresh which can fresh the whole webpage


## Testing plan
during test stratgy,we need to test every function one by one,including system testing
the tester should have the ability to understand customers point of view,then we should test the whole
program,the goal is to test the whole program to see what will happen,
if anything uxpected occure ,then we need to fix them.

## Maintenance plan
Since the interface was designed to be as dynamic as possible, the only part of the web that could require maintenance
is the data API itself. This information can easily be changed by adjusting a single variable in the code,our teammate will do the mainly maintenance and fix bug 

#### Design:

The project it's sample web applicatin that allow to the users to register in the page.
there shall be CSS Reference and CSS Properties that will make the page easier to use and understandable.
this project it will make junior developer increasing his/her knowledge 
and make them work as a time and also allowing 
them to contribute a lot to the projects' development.  
by using classes an id we can divied the work into neat bundles 
of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. the work should use simple functionality that will make code 
neater throughout the entire project so the project will be very simple one.

##### Functionality:
 First page will have a well designed regestration system page. After which the user will be redirected to their supposed forms, I.e the admin will be directied to the users management form and the user will be taken to the booking flight form where they can fill up the information required.

 ## Testing plan

Test strategy is that,we should test every function one by one ,including system testing
the tester should have the ability to understand user point of view,then we should test the whole
program, the goal is that what basic thing user want from our App, is firstly information about flight , so we test flight details first and then we upload it and also , and we test database so that user can easly sign up and then can sign in without any trouble, for testing the booking system we give wrong information if it gives us ticekt so we need to fix it . 

## TDD

Test strategy is that,we should test every function one by one ,including system testing
the tester should have the ability to understand user point of view,then we should test the whole
program, the goal is that what basic thing user want from our App, is firstly information about flight , so we test flight details first and then we upload it and also , and we test database so that user can easly sign up and then can sign in without any trouble, for testing the booking system we give wrong information if it gives us ticekt so we need to fix it . 

__current situation__

As the world gets more and more efficent technology needs to move along with it, and so we have the idea to create an application that will make it very easy for the user to 
register for now,we have decided how the project should look like and we have got a team of 5 people who will be working on it.


__Functional design__

Login button  - by clicking this button the web sit will take you to your page.
Search button - this function will work to find the available course that the user searched for.
SignUp button - this function will take the user to the signup page.
About button - this function will take the user to the about page.
Contact button - this function will take the user to the contact page.
JoinUs button - this function will take the user to the register for a course  page.

## Open Questions
 Any open issues that you aren't sure about, contentious decisions that you'd like readers to weigh in on, suggested future work, and so on. A tongue-in-cheek name for this section is the 'known unknowns'.we would like to welcome any suggestion that can improve our working environment and the webpage design

 ## Maintenance plan

The resevation system has to evaluated regularly in order to assess whetherthe existing one is still useful or a new reservation system will be needed, by this we remove the existing errors as well as the enhancement of the currently used reservation system. Thus, it is an important stage since it greatly affects the cost that has to be incurred by the Airline Ticket Reservation System  whether modification can still be done or  entirely new reservation system is required.

## Summary
For the success of this system we will rely mostly on peer programming to minimise the errors that programmers may have. Our main focus will be on creating a user-friendly system that does not discriminate against gender, race, age, ethnic group and so on so our design will be highly maintained by allowing users to send emails should they wish to make comments or complaints about the design.
