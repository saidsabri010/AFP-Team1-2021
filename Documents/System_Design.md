In recent years, with the development of the Internet, the application of network technology has been deepened, web page production and website construction have become more and more popular, and various web pages and website construction software have emerged one after another. A webpage is a window for displaying information on the Internet. Whether the webpage is made and designed exquisitely, whether it is rich in content, and whether it is easy to operate is the main factor that attracts users. Web page design and production is one of the basic skills that need to be mastered when learning information technology in the Internet age.

## Overview

A high level summary that every engineer at the company should understand and use to decide if it's useful for them to read the rest of the doc. It should be 3 paragraphs max.

## Goals

describe the user-driven impact of your project ' where your user might be another engineering team or even another technical system specify how to measure success using metrics ' bonus points if you can link to a dashboard that tracks those metrics Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won't be fixing so everyone is on the same page.

## Design
Page planning:

Front presentation: home page, detail page,search, register, login, logout

## Architectural plan
The application's design is created via HTML and CSS. The HTML contains wrapper classes and classes have boxes 
where user can type username and password into it and there are also some buttons which can share this website to other friends.
then we have some taps which show user different topics of other information
As it is a static webpage ,you can do fresh which can fresh the whole webpage


## Testing plan
during test stratgy,we need to test every function one by one,including system testing
the tester should have the ability to understand customers point of view,then we should test the whole
program,the goal is to test the whole program to see what will happen,
if anything uxpected occure ,then we need to fix them.

## Maintenance plan
Since the interface was designed to be as dynamic as possible, the only part of the web that could require maintenance
is the data API itself. This information can easily be changed by adjusting a single variable in the code,

#### Design:

The project it's sample web applicatin that allow to the users to register in the page.
there shall be CSS Reference and CSS Properties that will make the page easier to use and understandable.
this project it will make junior developer increasing his/her knowledge 
and make them work as a time and also allowing 
them to contribute a lot to the projects' development.  
by using classes an id we can divied the work into neat bundles 
of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. the work should use simple functionality that will make code 
neater throughout the entire project so the project will be very simple one.
